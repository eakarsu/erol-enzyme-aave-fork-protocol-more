### Introduction

Enzyme fork-based library for integrating with your javascript runtime application, for instance Reactjs and your javascript/typescript app. The library suports type defination.

The library allows user to have fund features of enzyme finance within his Dapp. It only requires you to deploy a set of new enzyme.finance smart contracts.

It also allows users to deposit collateral to aave and borrow any asset using deposited collateral.

### Features
- Creation of a new vault/fund with Fees and Policy configurations
- Deposit Collateral to aave protocol.
- Borrow any asset from aave protocol using deposited asset.
- Invest to already created fund. (Optional using the borrowed asset)
- Withdrawal/Claim your assets from a fund/Vault.
- List user created funds 
- List each fund's investments and transactions
- List authorized user funds, investment, and transactions.


### Installation

Using npm
```bash
$ npm install @devngeni/protocol
```

using yarn 
```bash
$ yarn add @devngeni/protocol
```

### Usage Example
Here we will go through the above named feature, and see how it is implemented. We will define a number of constants to use within this example. 

> N.B: Please change(dynamically evalute) them.


#### Test Subgraph

Queries (HTTP):     https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/trust0212/radar-graph
Subscriptions (WS): wss://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/trust0212/radar-graph.



#### CONSTANTS

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// provider & Signer
const HTTP_URL = "<infura-http-url>"
const PRIVATE_KEY = "Your-private-ke"

const PROVIDER = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(HTTP_URL);

const SIGNER = new ethers.Wallet(configs.PRIVATE_KEY, PROVIDER);

// Subgraph
const SUB_GRAPH_ENDPOINT_LINK = " https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/trust0212/radar-graph"

// AAVE Usage
const LP_ADDRESS_PROVIDER_ADDRESS =""; // kovan lendingPoolProviderAddress
const BORROW_ASSET = ""; //kovan DAI address
const DEPOSIT_ASSET = ""; // kovan WETH address

```


#### Platform Assets

This will give a list all the assets found in the enzyme fork. This includes blocked and whitelisted assets. Further you can be able to filter from your user interface.

```
const denominationAssets  =  await getDenominationAssets("SUB_GRAPH_ENDPOINT_LINK");
```

#### All Assets 

This list can help you handle different policies. Please you this list incase you want to blacklist or whitelist asset.

```
const assets  = await getAllAssetsIntegrations("SUB_GRAPH_ENDPOINT_LINK");
```


#### Create Fund/Vault


To create you need to prepare a few fields, this can be picked from your front-end or nodejs application.

```javascript
import {createNewFund}  from "@devngeni/protocol"

 const DENOMINATION_ASSET = "0xd0a1e359811322d97991e03f863a0c30c2cf029c"; // Kovan Wrapped Ether(WETH)

 // params

// Fee Configurations
  let feeConfigs = {
    entranceFee: "2",
    managementFee: "1",
    performanceFee: "5",
  };

  // Policy Configurations

  let policyConfig = {
    deposit: {
      minimum: "0",
      maximum: "5",
    },
    asset: {
      whiteList: [],
      blackList: [],
    },
    adpater: {
      whiteList: [],
      blackList: [],
    },
  };
 // Creating the actual fund

 try {
    const fund = await createNewFund(
      SIGNER,
      "POLICY CONFIGURATION 27/01/2022",
      DENOMINATION_ASSET,
      10000,
      "10000000",
      PROVIDER,
      feeConfigs,
      policyConfig
    );

      console.log(fund);
  }catch(err) {
    console.log(err)
  }

```
#### Aave Integrations

This enables user to be able to deposit collateral asset, and borrow any asset using the collateral.

##### Deposit Collateral

To Deposit collateral assets we use the `deposit(lendingPoolAddressesProvider, provider, signer, amount, asset_to_borrow)` method of `aaveProvider` named import. 

- `lendingPoolAddressesProvider` - lendingPoolAddressesProvider address. Refer  to [lendingPoolAddressesProvider](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/deployed-contracts/deployed-contracts)
- `provider` - ethers library ```ethers.provider.JsonRpcProvider``` instance.
- `signer` - wallet signer for instance ```ethers.Wallet```
- `amount` - amount of collateral to deposit
- `asset_to_deposit`  - address of the asset to deposit.

```javascript
// Example
import {aaveProvider}  from "@devngeni/protocol"

export const aaveBorrowAsset = async () => {
  return await deposit(
    LP_ADDRESS_PROVIDER_ADDRESS,
    PROVIDER,
    SIGNER,
    100,
    BORROW_ASSET
  );
};
```


##### Borrow Assets

To borrow assets we use the `borrow(lendingPoolAddressesProvider, provider, signer, amount, asset_to_borrow)` method of `aaveProvider` named import. 

- `lendingPoolAddressesProvider` - lendingPoolAddressesProvider address. Refer  to [lendingPoolAddressesProvider](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/deployed-contracts/deployed-contracts)
- `provider` - ethers library ```ethers.provider.JsonRpcProvider``` instance.
- `signer` - wallet signer for instance ```ethers.Wallet```
- `amount` - amount of collateral to borrow
- `asset_to_borrow`  - address of the asset to borrow.
```javascript
// Example

export const aaveBorrowAsset = async () => {
  return await deposit(
    LP_ADDRESS_PROVIDER_ADDRESS,
    PROVIDER,
    SIGNER,
    100, // amount of assets to borrow
    BORROW_ASSET
  );
};
```




#### Funds 

#### List Platform Funds

This will help you to get all funds within the system. You will have to do some pagination on the front-end

```
import {listAllFunds} from "@devngeni/protocol"
const funds  =  await listAllFunds("SUB_GRAPH_ENDPOINT_LINK");
```

#### User Vaults/Funds

```
import {
  walletAddressUserVaults} from "@devngeni/protocol"
const userFunds  = await walletAddressUserVaults("SUB_GRAPH_ENDPOINT_LINK");
```

#### List User Investments

```
import {getUserAddressInvestments} from "@devngeni/protocol"

const investments  = await getUserAddressInvestments("SUB_GRAPH_ENDPOINT_LINK");
```

### Contract Redeployment

Given the Application Bytecode Interface (ABI)  provided in this library if for test deployed in [kovan testnest](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/). Your can be able to deploy a set of new contracts.

You can find here the repo to all of the smart contracts.

> NB: The developer will be required to have an understanding of [solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/),  [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/),  hardhat deployment, and  debugging skills

#### Reployment Process

> Please follow documentation in the smart contract repo.
